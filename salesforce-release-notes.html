                This feature is an add on to the Sonic Disaster Relief grant type to accommodate the necessary fields and questions to run a beta test with SKQx. Our Sonic employees who are affect by a disaster will benefit from having this feature because they will be able to receive their funds faster. Also, the accounting team will benefit from this because there will be less, they would need to process. This addition solves the problem of mailing individual checks to our team members.
